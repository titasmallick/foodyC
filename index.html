<p><h3> Who We are?<br></h3>
Foody Couple is an online community dedicated to good food. 

Our tagline says "in 

quest of good food". We are a food blogger, food vlogger, 

food taster, reviewer. 

We love everything related to food. We currently run a 

facebook page and 

a facebook group that is dedicated to foods only. We visit 

different 

restaurants or street food corners and try out different foods in 

different 

category and we do share them with you all.<br> 
<h3> How did it was started?<br></h3>
It was started with a basic initiation from Titas Mallick and 

Sukanya Saha. They 

are a real-life couple and they love to eat good food at all. 

Sukaya loves to 

take pictures of the food and loves to share them with the 

world. Whereas Titas 

was always been a content creator. Their thoughts were 

merged. Foody Couple was 

born. It was all started in September of 2017. It was 

started as a very small 

food community and it is still kept on growing.<br> 
<h3>How do we operate?<br></h3>
We visit different restaurants and street food corners and 

try it ourselves. 

Restaurant owners also invite us to try out their food. As a 

group foodyC 

the community now also accepts an opinion from our viewers. In our 

Facebook group all 

the community members also share their quest for good food 

with the world. We 

are still growing.<br>

<h3>Why Food?<br></h3>
<b> Food doesn't have any 

cultural or lingual barrier. Food is itself a religion. 

That's why we love food. </b>

The language of the food is its taste. We search for 

that language. To
